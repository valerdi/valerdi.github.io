Hi there! Since completing my PhD in Mathematics in 2018, I have been working in the industry doing knowledge transfer. Recently, I have returned to mathematics, with research interests in motion estimation with event cameras and (polytope) neural network representability.

Here are some specific topics I am focusing on:

Event cameras
- Linear model-based methods for 2D and 3D flow.
- Depth estimation with LF-DVS.

Polytope neural networks
- CPWL depth conjecture.
- Minkowski sum depth conjecture.
- R^3 polytopes depth.
- Characterization of convex hull of zonotopes.
